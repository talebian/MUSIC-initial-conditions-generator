# MUSIC-initial-conditions-generator - Beginner's Guide
It is my first experience in using MUSIC code to generate initial condition for cosmological simulations.

> **Note**: This repository documents my first experience using the MUSIC code for cosmological simulations. 
> As a beginner, I'm sharing my learning journey to help others navigate the setup and configuration process.

## Why I Created This Guide
When I first started using MUSIC, I found the learning curve quite steep. This repository aims to create a reference for my future work and for other beginners.

## Introduction
MUSIC (Multi-Scale Initial Conditions) is a powerful program for generating nested grid initial conditions for high-resolution "zoom" cosmological simulations. This code enables researchers to create sophisticated initial conditions for studying structure formation in the universe, with particular focus on high-resolution regions embedded within larger cosmological volumes.

## Clone
I cloned the source code using

```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/ohahn/music.git
```

Then go to the directory

```bash
cd music
```
and greate a new folder

```bash
mkdir build
```
